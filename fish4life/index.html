            <h2>Our Purpose:</h2>
            <p>Have you ever wanted to get into fly fishing but have not known where to start ? I know I used to be just
                like that! You either know how to fly fish or you don’t. There seems like there is no in between! I
                always felt like I couldn’t start because I haven’t been doing it my whole life. That is why I made this
                informative and helpful website to help you either get started into fly fishing, or continue to develop
                your skills and knowledge in the art. It includes prime locations for fishing, helpful videos with tips
                on how to fish, correct seasons to use specific flies and other information that will help you enjoy and
                grow in the beautiful hobby of fly fishing.</p>

            <h2>Intro To Fly Fishing:</h2>
            <p>Fly fishing uses a very different rod than a normal fishing pole. Both need bait to try and attract the
                fish to take a bite out of whatever is on the hook. Normal fishing is comprised of either bait and
                bobber fishing or using a spinner to attract the fish to eat the hook. Fly fishing is very different and
                requires skill to imitate insects as they either hatch or live in the river. You can fly fish almost any
                river because you have flies that are either in the water or outside depending on the time of year. Fly
                fishing Equipment: A fly rod is used when fly fishing and is a lot longer than a normal fishing pole and
                comes in different lengths and weights. The weight and length of the rod depend on what type of fishing
                you are doing. The rod is used to direct and cast the line and fly to specific spots. The fly reel holds
                the different lines used for fishing and the kind of reel you use depends on the weight of your rod. The
                reel’s purpose is to attach the fly to the rod so that it can be directed as you cast. The reel holds
                three different types of fly lines. The first is a backing line and is what attaches all the other lines
                to the reel with an arbor knot. The second is called the fly line and is normally different bright
                colors, buoyant thicker. It is the reason why you can cast a light fly far distances with a lot of
                velocity. The third is called a leader and is what is used for accuracy with casting. The fourth is
                called tippet and is a thin line that sinks due to the weight of the fly. The fly is then attached to
                the tippet, and you can use tippet to attach multiple flies together. There are different sizes of
                tippet and leaders. The smaller the number, the thicker the line. So, if I have a 5x leader with a 1x
                tippet, that would be horribly unbalanced and the chances of you breaking the leader is likely. The most
                important part of the rig is the fly. Without the fly, you cannot catch any fish. Knowing what type of
                fly to use is very important. Waders are also important but not necessary. Just allows for better access
                to certain spots.</p>
