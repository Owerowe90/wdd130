            <p> Island Park has a host of rivers, creeks and a lake that are fishable. The Henry’s fork river has a lot
                of
                BIG fish up towards the mountain spring that the river comes from. You can only fish about 3 miles from
                the
                spring in a place called the Tubs. The water goes from shallow to deep where a small creek runs into the
                river. There are a plethora of fish that are there year round. Water is crystal clear so you can spot
                good
                holes easily. There are a few places that you can access the river with cars, but most of it you must
                hike.
                Only problem is the amount of people floating the river. </p>

            <p>The Buffalo River is also another river up there. It is not as big as Henry’s but still has a lot of
                opportunity for fishing. Harder to access unless you have an offroad vehicle. The river doesn’t ever get
                super deep but still has some good-sized fish. Not as many people float that river so that is a plus.
                Henry’s Lake Is where both rivers empty into. It is a good-sized lake that gets stocked yearly. It has
                opportunity for shore fishing as well as boat fishing. The lake freezes over during the winter and
                allows for ice fishing. Warm River: The Warm River connects into the Henry’s Fork that comes of the lake
                clear up in island park. It comes through Ashton Idaho and has TONS of fish and is fished very heavily
                during the summer months. Blue ribbon river that is fun to fish. You can float or shore fish and have a
                great experience.</p>

                Palisades: Is a giant reservoir that has incredible views as well as great fishing. The reservoir can be
                fished from the boat and from the shore. You can fish above the dam and it has a lot of fish that like
                to chill there. Fly fishing there is also popular. Snake River: Snake River runs off the Palisades and
                is a beautiful and heavily fished river that is easy to access by car as well as ATV’s. It has lots and
                lots of opportunities to fish. There are a lot of fish and the river is big so it is easy to find your
                own spot.
