        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>Have you ever wanted to get into fly fishing but have not known where to start ? I know I used to be just
            like that! You either know how to fly fish or you don’t. There seems like there is no in between! I always
            felt like I couldn’t start because I haven’t been doing it my whole life. That is why I made this
            informative and helpful website to help you either get started into fly fishing, or continue to develop your
            skills and knowledge in the art. It includes prime locations for fishing, helpful videos with tips on how to

        <p>We aim to help fisherman and non-fisherman alike understand more about fishing. If the people that visit the
            site are beginners, we will have information to help them know how to get started. If the people that visit
            are experts but not super knowledgeable about fly fishing in Eastern Idaho, they too will learn and become

            Info about Fly Fishing:
            If people are unaware of what fly fishing is, we will explain the differences between fly fishing and normal
            fishing. Fly fishing uses a very different rod than a normal fishing pole. Both need bait to try and attract
            the fish to take a bite out of whatever is on the hook. Normal fishing is comprised of either bait and
            bobber fishing or using a spinner to attract the fish to eat the hook. Fly fishing is very different and
            requires skill to imitate insects as they either hatch or live in the river. You can fly fish almost any
            river because you have flies that are either in the water or outside depending on the time of year.
            Fly fishing Equipment:
            A fly rod is used when fly fishing and is a lot longer than a normal fishing pole and comes in different
            lengths and weights. The weight and length of the rod depend on what type of fishing you are doing. The rod
            is used to direct and cast the line and fly to specific spots. The fly reel holds the different lines used
            for fishing and the kind of reel you use depends on the weight of your rod. The reel’s purpose is to attach
            the fly to the rod so that it can be directed as you cast. The reel holds three different types of fly
            lines. The first is a backing line and is what attaches all the other lines to the reel with an arbor knot.
            The second is called the fly line and is normally different bright colors, buoyant thicker. It is the reason
            why you can cast a light fly far distances with a lot of velocity. The third is called a leader and is what
            is used for accuracy with casting. The fourth is called tippet and is a thin line that sinks due to the
            weight of the fly. The fly is then attached to the tippet, and you can use tippet to attach multiple flies
            together. There are different sizes of tippet and leaders. The smaller the number, the thicker the line. So,
            if I have a 5x leader with a 1x tippet, that would be horribly unbalanced and the chances of you breaking
            the leader is likely. The most important part of the rig is the fly. Without the fly, you cannot catch any
            fish. Knowing what type of fly to use is very important. Waders are also important but not necessary. Just
            allows for better access to certain spots.

            Island Park: Island Park has a host of rivers, creeks and a lake that are fishable. The Henry’s fork river
            has a lot of BIG fish up towards the mountain spring that the river comes from. You can only fish about 3
            miles from the spring in a place called the Tubs. The water goes from shallow to deep where a small creek
            runs into the river. There are a plethora of fish that are there year round. Water is crystal clear so you
            can spot good holes easily. There are a few places that you can access the river with cars, but most of it
            you must hike. Only problem is the amount of people floating the river. The Buffalo River is also another
            river up there. It is not as big as Henry’s but still has a lot of opportunity for fishing. Harder to access
            unless you have an offroad vehicle. The river doesn’t ever get super deep but still has some good-sized
            fish. Not as many people float that river so that is a plus. Henry’s Lake Is where both rivers empty into.
            It is a good-sized lake that gets stocked yearly. It has opportunity for shore fishing as well as boat
            fishing. The lake freezes over during the winter and allows for ice fishing.
            Warm River: The Warm River connects into the Henry’s Fork that comes of the lake clear up in island park. It
            comes through Ashton Idaho and has TONS of fish and is fished very heavily during the summer months. Blue
            ribbon river that is fun to fish. You can float or shore fish and have a great experience.
            Palisades: Is a giant reservoir that has incredible views as well as great fishing. The reservoir can be
            fished from the boat and from the shore. You can fish above the dam and it has a lot of fish that like to
            chill there. Fly fishing there is also popular.
            Snake River: Snake River runs off the Palisades and is a beautiful and heavily fished river that is easy to
            access by car as well as ATV’s. It has lots and lots of opportunities to fish. There are a lot of fish and
            the river is big so it is easy to find your own spot.

            Fish look for different types of flies during different times of the year There are three different
            categories of flies that you need to know. The wet, dry and streamer flies:
            Wet flies are supposed to imitate the nymph form of insects and are supposed to float down in the water at
            various depths. They sink.
            Dry flies are imitating the insects as they emerge from the depths and start to dry off to fly away and
            mate. The fish look for them floating on the surface and eat them. They float.
            Streamers are flies that are to get the attention of the fish and normally are bigger flies. They are flashy
            and can look like a small fish, leeches or other large aquatic animals. They are technically wet flies, but
            deserve their own category.

            Flies to fish in Eastern Idaho:
            Midges: Late February – April, September - December. Short lived hatch.
            Zebra Midge, Griffith Gnat
            Mayflies:
            Stoneflies: May – August. Awesome Hatch
            Stonefly, Salmon fly
            Caddis: May - September, Lots of different flies.
            Mahogany Dun, Trico, Speckled Spinner, Other Caddis’s
            Wooley Bugger: Always.
            San Juan Worm: Always.
            Parachute Adams: Always when there is a hatch. Imitator fly.
