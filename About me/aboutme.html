    <p>Hello! I am a CIT major with a minor in Business. I have changed my major a few times, the last of which was Biomedical science.
    I am really enjoying taking a different series of classes besides Biology. I love to be outside and honestly do anything outdoors. 
    Basically things like fishing, hiking, sports and hunting. I am currently working in the Registration Department on campus. Knowing 
    how to create a website or even edit one is really exciting to me because I will get the chance to help change and update the website
    we all use for school. So let me know if there is anything you would like me to change! :)</p>
    <p>I am married to my beautiful wife. We are currently pregnant with a baby boy which is super exciting! I originally was going to 
        attend UVU but she convinced me to not go to UVU after my mission but join her up here in Rexburg. And let me tell you, it was the 
        best decision I have ever made. </p>
